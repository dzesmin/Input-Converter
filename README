This directory contains Input Converter source files for the BART project.
It consists three modules:
InputConverter.py
PT.py
InitialPT.py


  InputConverter.py
=============================================================================
  This module currently contains one function readatm() that reads a TEA 
  final atmospheric file and returns a list containing number of layers in 
  the atmosphere, species names, radii, temperature, pressure, and each 
  species abundances separately. It opens an atm file to find markers for 
  species and the TEA data, retrieves the species list, reads data below the
  markers, and fills out data into corresponding arrays. The final 
  atmospheric file is produces based on the initial PT profile, thus 
  containing just initial PT values.
============================================================================

  initialPT.py
============================================================================
  Module that has two functions to produce an initial PT profile and plots 
  it. This module with the PT.py module is used in the BART initialization
  procedure. It produces and plots the non-inverted PT profile based on the
  Equation 2 in Madhusudhan and Seager 2009. The profile is then smoothed 
  using 1D Gaussian filter. The pressure array needs to be equally spaced 
  in log space. 
============================================================================

  PT.py 
============================================================================
  This module generates PT profiles for BART. The profiles are parametrized, 
  done in a similar fashion as in Madhusudhan and Seager 2009. The module
  contains the following functions:
  read_press_file()  - reads a pressure file and extracts a list of pressures
  planet_Teff()      - calculates planet effective temperate to constrain T3 
                       parameter
  PT_Inversion()     - generates inverted PT profile
  PT_NoInversion()   - generates non-inverted PT profile
  PT_generator()     - wrapper that calls either inverted or non-inverted 
                       generator
  plot_PT()          - plots PT profile
